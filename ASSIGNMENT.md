## Implement the Following:

- The Unvote function. A user can only unvote the candidate they voted, so implement the function with this in mind. Do it to the best of your understanding.
- Implement the batch nominate function, where you can submit a list of candidates to the chain to be added to the nominees' list.
- The Suspend election function. When you call it, it will open your wallet, but give an error because only the owner can do it.
- The End election function. Same as above.
- The disqualify candidate function. Only owner can call it.
- Implement the count votes function. It is supposed to return the current winner of the election, check the contracts for the data type/structure to expect.
- Implement the search bar at the top right, make it work.
- Fix the loading state logic for the buttons in the sidebar.

### Very importantly, add your first name and surname to the current list of candidates so that I will know you actually did something on the contract. When it is time, I will end the election, and there will be no more nominating
